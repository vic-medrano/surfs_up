- The SQLite databse was able to give us a large amount of data for the two months with 1,700 days worth of June temperatures. Additionally, the December data was able to yield a count of 1517. 
- From the images above it can be seen that the average temperatures for both June and December only differ by about 3 degrees. Leading us to believe that the temperature is relatiely consistent year-round.
- The max temperatures are also relatively simiar for the two months and one of the biggest differences can be seen when looking at the minimum temperatures and the bottom quarter percentile. 
## Summary
These results show that the weather on the island is relatively consistent year-round. Providing insight that if W.Avy's business relies on warmer temperatures then it is likely he will be successful given the consistency in temperatures. To further look into the weather data for June and December. it may also be helpful to analyze the preciptiation data for these two months as well. In addition to looking at the weather data it may also be useful to have tourist information and how tourists will impact W.Avy's business.
